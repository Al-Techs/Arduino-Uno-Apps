# Arduino Uno Apps (UNFINISHED)
Code to run custom apps on an Arduino Uno. Includes example code to create your own.

# How to play base games

You'll need 18 male to male jumper wires, an active and a passive buzzer, a potentiometer, a 1602 LCD screen (the code is built for it, but you might be able to edit it to work with other sizes), a breadboard (I used one with 64 tie points), and of course, an Arduino Uno.

You then wire up the materials like this:

Then, you open whatever Arduino Ide you use, and load the "computer.ino" sketch into it. Make sure you have the LiquidCrystal and pitches libraries installed.
For now, it just plays a sound and starts counting. (It is unfinished, after all.)
